# Assignment 5 - Python

Write a Python program that collects, summarizes, and e-mails all the programming assignments for this course. In particular, assuming the programs are in subdirectories a1, a2, ... a5 of directory csc344:

* for each assignment, generate a list of all identifiers used in the program (class, function, etc names) and place the [program, symbol] pairs in a "symbols" file (omitting duplicates). You do NOT need to specially screen keywords or builtin functions.

* create a web page in the csc344 directory with links to each of the files, along with the symbols file.

* create a zip file containing all assignment sources, but excluding non-sources (executables, .class files, etc).

* prompt the user for a mail adress and send the zip file
