Write a C (or C++) program that reports the number of SLOC "logical lines of source code" for any Java program. As discussed in class, the definition of SLOC is not universally agreed upon, so you will need to document and defend the metric your program uses. Also print the number of "{...}" scopes at each level (1 for class, 2 for methods, etc). The input Java source file can be read from standard input.
